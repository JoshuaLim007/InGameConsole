# IGC for Unity
created by Joshua Lim

## Important Notes!
**Make sure you have TMPro installed and imported into your project! If not, Unity will freeze when you open the InGameConsole Manager**.

**If you are using a custom assembly definition, make sure you reference Lim.InGameConsole.Core assembly**.

## Installation:

Copy this git URL:
>https://github.com/JoshuaLim007/InGameConsole.git

and paste it into Unity's UPM "Add package from git URL".
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

**OR**

Download this onto your computer. And install it via local drive.
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html


## Getting started

Go to the top of the Unity window and navigate to **InGameConsole -> InGameConsoleManager**
Here you will have access to the console settings. Press **Toggle Preview** to edit these settings. Make sure to press **Save** before exiting.

The console will be **automatically created** when you enter play mode; there is no need to create the prefab of the console. Every scene in build settings will have a console after the project is built.


### Important Settings
**Make sure all the assemblies with your console commands are checked in the settings!** This will allow the program to find your console commands in the assemblies.

### Controls
- **"Tab"** Autofill the command
- **"Up/Down arrow keys"** Navigate through the console history
- **"F3"** Default key to open console

## IGC documentation

 **Namespace:**
To access the api you will need to according namespace:
>using namespace Lim.InGameConsole;

 **Creating Custom Commands:**
Use **[ConsoleCommand]** method attribute:
```
public class TestScript{
	[ConsoleCommand]
	public static void method_number(){
		//your code
	}
}
```

**Requirements**
- Method must be static
- Parameters must be a primative type

 **Calling Commands via IGC:**
Commands will be formatted in class to method name hiearchy. 

For:

```
public class className{
	[ConsoleCommand]
	public static void methodName(int amount, string name){
		//your code
	}
}
```
You will type:
>className.methodName(int32, string)
